* main.c -- a minimal wrapper to run lua files without the interactive
  cmd interpreter (therefore, without readline or ncurses).  This saves
  about 350 kB of virtual memory and 160 kB of RSS.  Probably not worth

  upload, and entry of titles and descriptions.  Saving of this is missing.


Mit Feb  7 15:55:48 CET 2007
* FTP Upload now properly works with win32, too.

* notebook example now runs without runtime errors (again).


Son Jul  1 01:38:29 CEST 2007
* Bugfixes
* gen-list.pl: detect typedefs that are effectively declaring a child class
  with unchanged attributes (but possibly other methods, example GdkWindow).
* examples/pixmap.lua mostly working; segfaults after resizing the window
  for a while.


Mon Jul  2 22:21:56 CEST 2007
* use full hash for function hash.  This avoids the problem of finding
  parameters for the wrong function.  Can happen when trying to call a
  deprecated function which exists, but is not in the function hash.
  Example: gtk_entry_set_position vs. gtk_editable_set_position.


Sam Jul 14 14:06:30 CEST 2007
* Updated doc/README.hash
* implement the usage of a minimal perfect hash function (from cmph).

* Bugfix: widget.c: malloc_handler now actually used where appropriate.


Son Dez  2 22:29:02 CET 2007
* luagtk_get_widget: the confusing manage_mem arg replaced by flags.

Mon Dez  3 21:18:55 CET 2007

* support PangoAttrList refcounting.
* Makefile: use $H instead of @ as suggested by Enrico Tassi


Die Dez 11 12:22:08 CET 2007
* gtk.done(): now prevents unloading of dynamically loaded libraries, thereby
  improving valgrind stack traces.
* calculator demo: show error messages in a separate text field
* allocate struct call_info with g_slice_alloc instead of g_malloc
* struct widget now has struct_nr instead of class_name; this is smaller on
  64 bit architectures, and provides additional information, esp. the
  structure size, required for g_slice_free.
* gtk.get_refcount returns the refcounting method (wiget type) as string
* gtk.done removed, its functionality now happens automatically using atexit
* use g_slice_alloc0 (not g_malloc) for manually allocated objects in gtk.new

  type.
* call return values now finds the correct type (with one level of indirections
  less)

faster, needs a little bit less data but a bit more core.

2008-03-26
* make-link.lua: evaluate optional conditions in the function list (to support
more Gtk versions)

2008-04-03

* better error message when a module uses a cmph method that's not supported
by the core module.
* automatically load the responsible module when a type is not found.

* bugfix for SEGV when using GtkTooltip, reported by Lucas Hermann Negri
* widget_handler "gobject" moved into src/glib/init.c

2008-08-25
* script/xml-parser.lua: comment update regarding "File" entries
* reorganization of html documentation (html_in -> doc/en, Makefiles)
* replace almost all lua_topointer with lua_touserdata
* boxed: lg_make_boxed_value uses a boxed value as-is if possible
* boxed: memory leaks fixed
* boxed: count currently allocated objects; return with gnome.box_debug()
* binary and source release from current CVS code.
* created a branch "rel-0-9" to continue maintenance of the old release.
* removal of api.find_func_in_module
* override for gtk_tree_model_get_value reinstated in a simpler version
* fundamental type "float": ffi2lua function added
* mechanism to add function aliases in spec.lua - aliases
* aliases for gdk_drawable_draw_xxx to gdk_draw_xxx
* mechanism to omit functions: spec.lua - ignore_functions
* struct ffi_type_map_t: removed lua2ffi_idx, ffi2lua_idx, lua2struct_idx,
struct2lua_idx; added just conv_idx and structconv_idx.  The structure is
currently 34 bit long, which is padded to 64 bit again.  Added code complexity
to check for NULL values in the jump tables -- not such a good idea after all?
* debug.function_sig: output the correct number of "*" for indirections
* layout improvements for documentation
* new example in the documentation: raedic
* colorization for example code
* renamed gtkdata.structs.c to types.c, and gtkdata.types.c to fundamentals.c

* porting of weather example and cms-admin to API 1.0
* int_ptr: if the user gives nil, no output is returned
* struct_ptr_ptr, char_ptr_ptr: if the user gives nil, nil is passed.  use
"true" to pass a pointer to a NULL pointer and treat it as output argument.
* fix to freeing of char_ptr_ptr (was broken)

2008-08-27
* replaced lghash.so with gnomedev.so

Donovan.  It offers a set of hand-coded bindings for a few widgets of Gtk 1.2
and is only known to work on Linux.
* simple hash: save space by not storing duplicate values
* cmph: use fixed 32 bit per bucket, and also combine duplicate values.

2008-11-05
* change in type_info_t.nn - instead of module_name_ofs have a flag
name_is_module: saves space (now 13 bit padding), remove struct
module_info.auto_depends.
* functions are now considered native types

2008-11-06
* glib.object_get_class now works
* can call function pointers in structures
* conversion of remaining char_ptr_handling.txt into spec.lua:function_flags
* simplification of script/configure.lua (removal of use_only_cflags,
setup_library2).
* all linklist.txt files are now converted into a section in spec.lua.
* most configure.lua files deleted, as they did exactly the same simple calls.  Only the core module (gnome) still has a (large) configure.lua.
* changed the TYPE_xxx constants to GENUS_xxx (in include/common.h).  After all
they are stored in the field "union type_info.nn.genus" etc.
* doc/en: documentation menu is now multi-level.  More documentation.
* gnome: rename widget*.c to object*.c
* gnome: rename luagtk_get_object to lg_get_object
* gnome: refactoring of all luagtk_ prefixed functions and types to lg_, as
this system is not limited to gtk anymore.

2008-11-07
* script/check-linklist.lua to aid weeding out unused entries in linklists
* struct module_info is automatically generated by parse-xml.lua now.
* can now access functions with their full name (i.e., without a prefix).
required for gtkhtml.

* src/gnome/object_meta.c: use lg_push_closure to create closures for functions instead of l_call_func.
* macros LG_ERROR and LG_ARGERROR, LG_MESSAGE with translatable messages
* new source file src/gnome/lang.c that translates messages using a Lua data file
* a few messages marked for translation, descriptions entered
* new module "lgtranslate" for my Lua web framework, with sql tables for messages, descriptions, translations, reviews, locations.
* script/upload-messages.lua is an adaption of extract-messages.lua to scan the C source and upload new/changed messages to the web server.


2008-12-30
* some types added to the include_types array various spec files, mainly glib.
* some fundamental types added to glib, like FILE, size_t, time_t.  Other modules may still complain during building but these types are now available.
